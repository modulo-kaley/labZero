## Part A: Arrow Functions
Write an arrow function called max that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns the elements in the array that are less than or equal to 100.

## Part B: Template Literals
Write a function called createGreeting that takes a name as an argument and returns a greeting message in the following format: "Hello, [Name]!"

## Part C: Destructuring
Use object destructuring to extract the name and age properties into variables. Print “Hello! My name is [Name] and I am [Age] years old.”

## Part D: Spread Operators
Write a function called mergeArrays that takes two arrays as arguments and returns a new array containing all elements from both arrays using the spread operator.

## Part E: Let and Const Variables
For each of the provided code scenarios, change the variable to either const and let. Remember let variables can be reassigned to a new value, while const variables cannot be reassigned once declared (but their properties can be modified for objects and elements added for arrays).

## Part F: Classes and Inheritance
Implement a class called Rectangle that has properties width and height. The class should have a method called getArea that returns the area of the rectangle.

Create a subclass called Square that extends the Rectangle class. The Square class should have a method called getPerimeter that returns the perimeter of the square.
